# About
Subsweep is a code for postprocessing of astrophysical simulations using
the [sweep method for radiative transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12848).

# Installation
The rust `nightly` toolchain is required to install subsweep.
```
rustup default nightly
```

With the nightly toolchain, subsweep can be compiled via cargo
```
cargo build --release
```

To run the test suite:
```
cargo test
```

For production runs, building with LTO enabled is recommended (compilation can take a long time).
```
cargo build --release-lto
```

# General Usage
Subsweep takes output from cosmological simulations (Currently only read-in of Arepo output is supported (TODO LINK)) and performs radiative transfer coupled with radiation chemistry.
This process works as follows:

1. The initial conditions (simulation output of coordinates, densities, temperatures and chemical composition) are read. This also includes the source terms for radiative transfer.
2. Domain decomposition of the loaded particles from the ICs.
3. If desired, temperatures and chemical composition will be remapped from the output of a previous subsweep run (useful for chained runs).
4. A voronoi grid over the particles is either constructed or read from a grid file. In the latter case, the grid file can be generated by running Arepo using the sweep-write-grid branch. Whether the grid is constructed or read is determined by the simulation parameters.
5. Using the grid, radiative transfer and chemistry updates are performed until the desired final time. Output snapshots are written at regular intervals.

# Parameters
Subsweep requires a single parameter file in yaml format (called `params.yml` unless explicitly specified otherwise). An example parameter consists of individual sections and might read as follows:

- `box_size`: Specifies the size of the simulation box. Accepted units are either a length (for non-comoving runs) or a comoving length (length times `h^-1 a^-1`) for runs in which the original simulation is comoving and should be rescaled according to the cosmology.
- `postprocess`:
- - `initial_fraction_ionized_hydrogen`: Initial ionization fraction which is set for every particle. Only useful when not remapping from a previous output.
- - `sources`: How the source terms should be determined. For non-test runs, the only relevant option is `!from_ics`, in which case the `escape_fraction` parameter specifies a factor by which the computed source terms should be multiply for account for unresolved overdensities surrounding the sources.
- - `grid`: either `!construct` if the grid should be constructed or `!read GRID_FILE` if the grid should be read from `GRID_FILE`
- - `remap_from`: If given, specifies a file or a folder (in which case all the hdf5 files in the folder are used) from which to remap temperatures and ionization fractions.
- `sweep`:
- - `directions`: The number of directions to use. More means higher angular resolution at the cost of memory and runtime.
- - `num_timestep_levels`: How many levels of substepping to use. If `1`, sweeps and chemistry updates are always done at level `0`, using the `max_timestep` (the chemistry will internally substep if required). If `n > 1`, particles will be distributed onto the available levels `i=0..n-1` according to their desired timesteps. The timestep of level `i` is given by `max_timestep * 2^-i`. The desired timestep is computed as the minimum of the timescales at which the 1. ionization fraction, 2. temperature and 3. photon rates change.
- - `significant_rate_threshold`: The minimum number of photons per second which will be treated as non-zero. A non-zero value (~1.0e-5 / s) is recommended for performance reasons.
- - `timestep_safety_factor`: The ratio of desired timestep to computed timescale at which the fastest changing quantity changes. Smaller values mean more accurate results but come at the cost of performance since more particles will move to lower timesteps.
- - `check_deadlock`: Defaults to `false`. If `true`, check for deadlocks before sweeping. This is mostly meant for debugging.
